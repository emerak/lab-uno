# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
#
   zoos = Zoo.create([{name: 'San Diego Zoo'}, {name: 'Metropolitan Zoo'}, {name: 'Zoologico de Guadalajara'}])

   Specie.create([{name: 'Monkey'}, {name: 'Eagle'}, {name: 'Rabbit'}])
